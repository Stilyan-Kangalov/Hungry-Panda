# Hungry Panda
Hungry Panda: Clipboard &amp; Notepad - Google Chrome extension.

★ You can copy as much text as you want with only 2 clicks and the extension already saves it for you in a draft, so you don't have to copy / paste on a separate word file.<br />
★ Once you make a file, the text from the draft automatically goes there. It saves a lot of time when writing a paper and doing a research, collecting information online in general.

=|=| How to use |=|=
 
1. Open new tab, load web page and select your text.
2. Right click on it and choose 'Send Text to HungryPanda'.<br />
★ Repeat step 2 for every tab you want.<br />
★ All parts are stored as draft in the text area.
3. Edit the text (if needed) and save it with 'Save Text to File'.<br />
★ Important: The draft is only temporary storage!
